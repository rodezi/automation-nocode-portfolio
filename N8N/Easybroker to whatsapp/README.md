# N8N - EasyBroker To WhatsAPP API

## Here's one my projects in N8N for a Real Estate client. I did this automation inside N8N. 

This client wanted to automate the lead entry to get their contacts / leads in their Whatsapp.

The steps I took to solve the automation were:

*   1. Get their API from Easybroker
*   2. Make a HTTP Request
*   3. Sort out the latest leads
*   4. Filter out the latest lead
*   5. split ->
*   6. Store the lead into a CRM in Airtable
*   7. Contact the lead with a template
